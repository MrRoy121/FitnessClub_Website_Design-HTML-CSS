    <h1>Guided Running and Racing</h1>
      <p>The GEC running program is designed is to guide and motivate runners to a personal best in their run training and racing. The training program is heavily coached and has a moderately aggressive approach to achieving your personal best. We will educate you on proper running form, biomechanics, training, nutrition and mental toughness
<br><br>
        You will work with a GEC coach twice weekly to help you accomplish your goals and you'll have the companionship of others reaching for similar goals. At times, we'll have assistant coaches to decrease the coach to athlete ratio for a higher quality experience. Spend your workouts completing track workouts, hills repeats tempo runs, strength/power running, endurance strength training, and more. Each week will challenge you, and be tailored towards your goals from sprint races, 5K runs, or full-distance marathons.
        <br><br>    
        The course meets for 90 minutes twice a week. You have the choice among the following morning and evening sessions:
        <br></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 20px;">    11:30 AM - 1:00 PM (MW)<br>
           5:00 PM - 6:30 PM (TR)</p>

           <h2>Course Outline</h2>
           <p>The running class will meet at the Falk Running Center and, when weather permits, we'll be outside at the Falk Running Track.
